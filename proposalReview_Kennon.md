Some general comments on your proposal:

-Explain the terms a little more for the venn diagram visual.  Specifically, their impact. [page 1]
-What does the exposure term mean? [page 2]
-You give a good example of a pitfall with longitudinal property of the data. [page 2]
-Good mathematical reasoning in description of pitfalls. [page 3]
-One question/concern I have about the neural network and decision tree approaches is:
  Is there enough training data to provide sufficient parameters given all of the indicator variables? [page 3]


----------
Great goals and outline for future work to be done.  This looks like a very interesting and promising project, good luck!
